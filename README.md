## How It's Made:

**Technologies used:** MongoDB, Mongoose, Express, Passport Azure AD, Multer, EJS, Cloudinary, JavaScript

We used MongoDB to store our user data (names, emails, sessions) and connected our database using passport and Microsoft Azure AD to allow our app to authenticate users easily. We then created routes for users to update their profile using the CRUD method. In addition, we utilized the Multer’s API so users could upload images and Cloudinary to update them. Using EJS, we were able to get our user’s images back from the database to showcase.

## Lessons Learned:

Before writing any code, we all decided it was best to write out a list of things we felt that we needed for an MVP - user login and the ability for the user to post an image to their profile. At first, we discussed the possibility of working on separate parts of the project as that would get us to our goal the fastest. At the end of our first meeting, we ultimately decided that it was best to work on each part together. In doing so, we delegated ourselves to research and debug whenever we ran into problems. We got to know each other along the way and made creating this app a lot of fun. This was the first time any of us have used half of the names in our stack so you can believe me when I say a lot of googling was involved.
